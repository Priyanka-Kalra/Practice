div- is used to make block containers
span-is used to make inline containers
//refer video 31 6:07

//entity code for reserved characters like -'<','>','&'
header,footer,main,nav are all similar to div but used for different functions and have a meaning associated with each of it,called semantic markup

//avoid inline and important
//specificity of inline>id>class>elements
//we could give atmost importance by using '!important'
eg. h2{
    color:black !important;
}

u can make any block element to inline and vice versa:
h1{
    display:inline;
}
span{
    display:block;
}

//alpa regulates only the background colour,eg; background-color:rgba(200,189,10,0.9)
//opacity changes every content including text,button,etc(ranges from 0-1) (opacity:0.4)

//transition time can decide how long does it change to chek,eg transition.html,see video 94 and mdn and ppt from udemy
