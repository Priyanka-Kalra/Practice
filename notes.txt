span-is used to make inline containers
//refer video 31 6:07

//entity code for reserved characters like -'<','>','&'
header,footer,main,nav are all similar to div but used for different functions and have a meaning associated with each of it,called semantic markup

//avoid inline and important
//specificity of inline>id>class>elements
//we could give atmost importance by using '!important'
eg. h2{
    color:black !important;
}

u can make any block element to inline and vice versa:
h1{
    display:inline;
}
span{
    display:block;
}
