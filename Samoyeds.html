    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Samoyed (/ˈsæməjɛd/ SAM-ə-yed or /səˈmɔɪ.ɛd/ sə-MOY-ed;[1] Russian: Самое́дская соба́ка or Самое́д) is a
        breed of
        medium-sized herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are a spitz-type dog which takes its name
        from
        the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoyeds">Samoyedic peoples</a>of Siberia. Descending from the Nenets Herding Laika, they are a domesticated animal that
        assists
        in
        herding, hunting, protection and sled-pulling.
        Samoyed dogs are most often white, and can have a brown tint to their double-layer coat which is naturally
        dirt-repellent. They are known to be used in expeditions in both Arctic and Antarctic regions and have a
        friendly
        and
        agreeable disposition.</p>
